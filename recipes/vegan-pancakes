        <ol>
            <li>Get your large bowl and put your spelt flour, hemp seeds, agave, sea moss (of your choice), and grapeseed oil. Please make sure NOT to add the hemp milk at this time as this can create lumps when mixed in with the grapeseed oil directly. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of hemp milk and then pour the alkaline water until you have the consistency to your liking. The more water you add the lighter the batter will be. If you want it to have some bulk, less water is ideal. </li>
            <li>Place the blueberries and fruits of your choice such as bananas. Fold them into the batter.</li>
            <li>Heat your pan to reach a medium heat. Brush some grapeseed oil on its surface. </li>
            <li>Pour your batter into the pan. Cook each side for 3-5 minutes each. </li>
            <li>Plate your pancakes and add some visual appeal with blueberries on the side.</li>
            <li>If you would like your pancakes fully cooked you can have your oven at 350 °F for just a few minutes.</li>
        </ol>
