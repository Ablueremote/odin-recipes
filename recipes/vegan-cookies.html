        <header>Steps</header>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a smaller bowl, add coconut oil and almond butter. Melt in the microwave, about 30 seconds. Add maple syrup and vanilla, and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients, and then mix in both the quick oats and the rolled oats. The dough will be wet and soft.</li>
            <li>Measure out 2 Tbsp. dough per cookie and shape your cookies into a flat circle.</li>
            <li>Add your raw cane sugar to a small bowl. Coat each cookie in the sugar, and then place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove your cookies from the oven and press each of the cookies down slightly with a flat surface, like the back of a measuring cup. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then move your cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Store in an air-tight container. I'm a huge fan of cookies straight from the fridge, but you can store them at room temperature as well.</li>
        </ol>
